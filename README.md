Phishing Framework (Under Development / Only FrontEnd) 
Overview
This phishing framework is under development and is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the techniques used in phishing attacks. The goal of this project is to provide a controlled, ethical environment where security professionals and ethical hackers can practice and test their knowledge in identifying phishing techniques and vulnerabilities.

Note: This framework is not to be used for illegal activities. It is intended solely for research, training, and improving cybersecurity awareness.

Features (Under Development)
Pre-built Templates: The framework includes customizable phishing page templates that simulate commonly used websites.
Automated Campaigns: Allows the user to launch phishing campaigns with automated email spoofing and social engineering tools.
Data Capture: Collects data from victims' interactions with the phishing pages (for authorized testing environments).
Reporting: Generates reports on the success of phishing campaigns for analysis and improvement.
Dashboard: Provides an easy-to-use dashboard for campaign management and viewing captured data.


Usage
Once the server is up and running, you can access the phishing framework through the web interface:

Create a Campaign: Choose from a list of pre-built phishing templates (e.g., login pages, fake password reset forms).
Customize Templates: Edit the templates to fit the phishing scenario you are simulating.
Launch Campaign: Start the campaign and use the automated email sender to distribute phishing links to test subjects (with proper authorization).
Monitor and Report: Track the performance of your phishing campaigns via the dashboard and generate reports.
Important Considerations
Authorization: Ensure you have explicit permission to run phishing tests on the target network or individuals. Unauthorized use of phishing attacks is illegal and unethical.
Data Handling: Any data captured through the phishing pages should be handled securely and only used in controlled, ethical environments for testing and educational purposes.
Security: Make sure the framework is used responsibly and is not exposed to the public unless properly secured.
